## Background

I am currently a second year University of Auckland student. In my first year I did biology and chemistry, but became interested in computer science and statistics when doing STATS101 online projects. I am now a computer science and statistics double major. I don't have any experience whatsoever with computer science but I am very keen to learn as much as possible!
