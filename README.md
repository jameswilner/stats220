# **James Wilner - Stats220**

This repo is created in order to create a public way of displaying my achievements through various coding activities

## Background

I am currently a second year University of Auckland student. In my first year I did biology and chemistry, but became interested in computer science and statistics when doing STATS101 online projects. I am now a computer science and statistics double major. I don't have any experience whatsoever with computer science but I am very keen to learn as much as possible!

## What I hope to gain from future work with technology
- Ability to build a basic website
- Basic understanding of multiple different coding languages
- Ability to troubleshoot and fix minor computer bugs/errors
- A hollistic understanding of how all the different parts of a computer work together to create a product
